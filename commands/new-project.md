description: Set up Claude Code documentation structure for a new project
---

# New Project Setup

This command sets up the documentation structure for a new project to work with Claude Code agents.

## Documentation Structure

Every project needs these files:

```
project/
├── CLAUDE.md                    # How to work on this project (stable)
└── docs/
    ├── PROJECT_STATE.md         # Current codebase state (living document)
    ├── roadmap.md               # Task index - mirrors Linear (fallback)
    ├── technical-specs/         # Spec files per issue
    │   └── {ISSUE_ID}.md
    └── sprints/                 # Sprint iteration tracking
        └── sprint-###-[name].md
```

### CLAUDE.md (Root)

**Purpose:** Entry point for agents. How to operate on this project.
**Updates:** Rarely. Only when workflows or tooling change.

**Contains:**
- Quick start (points to PROJECT_STATE.md)
- Running commands (dev server, tests)
- Working with agents (EM + /sprint workflow)
- Linear integration (team, issue prefix)
- Before you commit checklist

**Does NOT contain:**
- File structure (goes in PROJECT_STATE.md)
- Database schema (goes in PROJECT_STATE.md)
- API endpoints (goes in PROJECT_STATE.md)
- Key technical decisions (goes in PROJECT_STATE.md)
- Known issues (goes in Linear)

### docs/PROJECT_STATE.md

**Purpose:** Current state of the codebase. Living reference for agents.
**Updates:** After every deployment by Developer agent.

**Contains:**
- File structure
- Database schema
- API endpoints
- Tech stack
- Key technical decisions
- Infrastructure/deployment config
- Recent changes (last 10)
- Supported features

### docs/roadmap.md

**Purpose:** Index of all technical specs. Mirrors Linear as a fallback.
**Updates:** When issues are created, completed, or status changes.

**Contains:**
- Active sprint tasks with status
- Backlog items
- Completed items (recent)
- Links to spec files

**Use as fallback** when Linear is unavailable.

### docs/technical-specs/{ISSUE_ID}.md

**Purpose:** Single spec file per issue containing exploration + implementation plan.
**Updates:** Explorer creates, Plan-Writer updates, Developer tracks progress.

---

## CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Claude Code Project Guide

> Start here when working on this project.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Read the project state first:** `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`
   - File structure, database schema, API endpoints
   - Tech stack, infrastructure, recent changes

2. **Check roadmap:** `docs/roadmap.md`
   - Current sprint tasks
   - Fallback when Linear unavailable

---

## Running the Project

### Backend
\`\`\`bash
cd /path/to/project/backend
# Add your run command
\`\`\`

### Frontend
\`\`\`bash
cd /path/to/project/frontend
# Add your run command
\`\`\`

### Tests
\`\`\`bash
# Backend tests
# Frontend tests
\`\`\`

---

## Working with Agents

Use the **EM agent** for task coordination and the `/sprint` command for autonomous execution.

### Workflow
\`\`\`
ROY (request/issue)
    ↓
ENG MANAGER — prioritizes, coordinates
    ↓
EXPLORER — analyzes → creates docs/technical-specs/{ISSUE_ID}.md
    ↓
PLAN-WRITER — plans → updates docs/technical-specs/{ISSUE_ID}.md
    ↓
ROY (approves plan) ← CHECKPOINT
    ↓
DEVELOPER — implements → reads spec file
    ↓
REVIEWER — validates
\`\`\`

### Key Commands
- **EM agent**: Task assignment, status updates, roadmap management
- **`/sprint`**: Autonomous execution of Priority 1 tasks from Linear

---

## Linear Integration

**Note:** Set `linear_enabled: false` if this project doesn't use Linear. All task tracking will use roadmap.md only.

linear_enabled: true

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Issue Prefix | `XXX` |
| Team | TeamName |
| Team ID | `<team-uuid>` |
| Technical Specs | `docs/technical-specs/XXX-##.md` |

### Status UUIDs (for `mcp_linear_update_issue`)

| Status | UUID |
|--------|------|
| Backlog | `<uuid>` |
| Todo | `<uuid>` |
| In Progress | `<uuid>` |
| In Review | `<uuid>` |
| Done | `<uuid>` |
| Canceled | `<uuid>` |

> **To get UUIDs:** Run `curl -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "{ team(id: \"TEAM_ID\") { states { nodes { id name } } } }"}'`

### Labels

| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| agent | Applied to ALL issues created by Claude (not human-created) |
| technical | Applied to backend/infra/tech-debt issues Claude inferred or initiated |

> **Note:** Create these labels in Linear if they don't exist. Agent will apply them automatically.

All task tracking happens in Linear. Agents post updates as comments on issues.
Use `docs/roadmap.md` as fallback when Linear is unavailable.

---

## MCP Configuration

Disable unused MCPs to save context. Add to project's `.claude/settings.json`:

\`\`\`json
{
  "disabledMcpServers": ["slack", "notion", "jira"]
}
\`\`\`

Only Linear is typically needed. Disable others unless the project requires them.

---

## Deployment

| Environment | Branch | URL |
|-------------|--------|-----|
| Staging | `develop` | [your-staging-url] |
| Production | `main` | [your-production-url] |

**Git workflow:** `feature/*` → `develop` (staging) → `main` (production)

**Who can push:**
- `develop`: Developer (after Reviewer approval)
- `main`: User only

## Notes

- **Linear is source of truth** - this file mirrors it
- **Sync timing:** After Linear changes, at sprint start, at sprint end
- If Linear unavailable, this becomes temporary source of truth
- When Linear is added/restored, EM reconciles (shows diff, User approves)
- Specs live in `technical-specs/{ISSUE_ID}.md`
```

---

## CI/CD (Optional - Recommended for Production Apps)

For production applications, add GitHub Actions to run tests before merging.

**When to add CI/CD:**
- Production apps with real users → Yes
- Prototypes/experiments → No (slows you down)
- Side projects → Maybe (depends on complexity)

**Suggested workflow file** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [develop, main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [develop, main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run build

  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
      - run: npm run test:e2e
        env:
          PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop' && 'YOUR_STAGING_URL' || github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 'YOUR_PROD_URL' || '' }}
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

**Reference:** See `quo` project for a full CI/CD implementation with Vercel.

## Setup Checklist

When setting up a new project:

1. [ ] Create `CLAUDE.md` in project root using template above
2. [ ] Create `docs/` directory
3. [ ] Create `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` using template above
4. [ ] Create `docs/roadmap.md` using template above
5. [ ] Create `docs/technical-specs/` directory
6. [ ] Create `docs/sprints/` directory (for sprint iteration tracking)
7. [ ] **Decide if project uses Linear:**
   - Set `linear_enabled: true` in CLAUDE.md (requires steps 8-11)
   - OR set `linear_enabled: false` (skip steps 8-11, use roadmap.md only)
8. [ ] Set up Linear team and issue prefix (if enabled)
9. [ ] Add project to Linear with correct team assignment (if enabled)
10. [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with actual Linear team and prefix (if enabled)
11. [ ] **Get Linear status UUIDs** and add to CLAUDE.md (if enabled - see below)
12. [ ] **Set up Git branches:** Create `develop` branch, configure auto-deploy to staging
13. [ ] **Add deployment URLs** to CLAUDE.md (staging + production)
13. [ ] **(Production apps)** Add GitHub Actions CI/CD (see template above)

### Getting Linear Status UUIDs

Run this GraphQL query (replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `TEAM_ID`):

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.linear.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"query": "{ team(id: \"TEAM_ID\") { states { nodes { id name } } } }"}'
```

Copy the UUIDs into your project's CLAUDE.md under "Status UUIDs".

---

## Agent Files (Global)

These agents are configured globally in `~/.claude/agents/`:

| Agent | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| EM | `em.md` | Task coordination, roadmap management |
| Explorer | `explorer.md` | Codebase analysis → creates spec file |
| Plan-Writer | `plan-writer.md` | Implementation plans → updates spec file |
| Developer | `developer.md` | Code implementation → reads/updates spec file |
| Reviewer | `reviewer.md` | Code review |

**Do not create project-specific agent files.** Use the global agents.

---

## The Spec File

Each issue gets a single spec file at `docs/technical-specs/{ISSUE_ID}.md`:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ docs/technical-specs/{ISSUE_ID}.md                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ## Summary                                              │
│ ## Exploration (by Explorer)                            │
│ ## Implementation Plan (by Plan-Writer)                 │
│   - [ ] 🟥 Task 1                                       │
│   - [ ] 🟥 Task 2                                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Flow:**
1. Explorer creates the file with exploration findings
2. Plan-Writer adds implementation plan to the same file
3. Developer updates progress (🟥→🟨→🟩) as they work
4. EM updates `docs/roadmap.md` to reflect status
